# CMSC701_Final_Project
A project to investigate algorithms for edit distance for short reads (150-300 base pairs).  In this project, we benchmark existing algorithms against our implementation which is designed to be optimal for short reads. See [edit-distance](/edit-distance/README.md) for more implementation details on our custom algorithm.
